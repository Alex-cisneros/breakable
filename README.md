# Breakable

This project aims to assist chaos engineers in thinking about creating robust UI experiences that can survive massive service outages successfully. The project intends to focus on modular architecture that pretends to be informed by microservices. It also intends to build out robust redundancy with service workers and fallbacks for critical routes.
